The TODO Web application is available in desktop view and mobile view.

Exercise 1: Plan of actions
Splash screen:
If the user has not signed up for our application yet or the browsercache does not have valid information for our web application, they will be shown two options(buttons) and a form(to fill in their user info):
1. SIGN-UP button that will send the user to the application page IF the user has correctly filled in the above form.
2. SIGN-IN button that show the user to the log-in pop-up venster. 

Log-in pop-up venster:
Here the user has to fill in their user.email and user.password in the shown form.
By clicking the SIGN-IN button the user information will be checked and if it is invalid the log-in page will be reloaded and an errortext will tell the user that the user information is invalid.
If the user information is valid, the SIGN-IN button will send the user to the application page.

<From this point on, if the browser settings allow this, the application page, with the user logged in, will always be loaded when the user returns to our site.>
